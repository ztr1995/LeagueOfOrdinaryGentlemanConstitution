### Commissioner Site Powers ###
The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams.
<br>
### Co-Commissioner Site Powers ###
The Co-Commissioners will have all site powers the league commissioner has so that in the event the commissioner is unavailable the co-commissioners can attend to any urgent needs from league members.
<br>
### Co-Commissioner Appointment ###
The Commissioner can nominate up to two Co-Commissioners who will then require a majority vote by the rest of the league to be appointed.
<br>
### Dispute Arbitration ###
The three league managers are the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie the commisioner will always have the tiebreaking vote.
<br>
### Rule Changes ###
When voting, owners have the options to ALLOW, DECLINE, or ABSTAIN. If an owner does not vote then their vote will be assumed based on whether the vote is during the season.

##### During the off season #####
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called and receive a 2/3 majority (in a tie the commissioner has the tiebreaking vote) of non-abstained votes (Minimum of 6 total votes). If an owner does not vote by the deadline set by the league managers then their vote will be counted as **ABSTAIN**.
<br>

##### During the season #####  
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called and receive a 100% vote (Minimum of 7 total votes). If an owner does not vote by the deadline set by the league managers then their vote will counted as **ALLOW**.
<br>
### Collusion ###
**Collusion will not be tolerated. A trade will be vetoed if there is evident collusion and if egregious enough then the guilty teams will have to pay a draft pick penalty decided by the league managers. The decided upon draft picks will be forfeited and voided. NOTE: There is a low chance we enforce this penalty, but if it is truly egregious/consistent enough then we will enforce a penalty.**

## __Section III - Free Agency & Trading__ ##

### Free Agency ###

- Any player that is on a [Practice Squad](#section-vi---practice-squad) or [Season Ending IR]() may not be added unless a proper claim is submitted.
- There is a two Day waiting period for waivers to clear
- Free agency locks at the keeper deadline.

**FYI, it is almost impossible for the LMs to keep up with every transaction that happens (specifically the first wave). It is YOUR responsibility to make sure the players you pick up aren't on someone else's p squad/IR. If you manage to play a player that someone else owns, then the players' points will be removed from your score and he will be removed from your team... and yes, if the player got negative points then the points for the player would be set to 0.**


### Trades ###
- Trades will be processed right away, if collusion is suspected the matter will be put to a League Manager vote. In the event of a conflict of interest, biased LMs cannot vote and a different owner would take the baised LM's responsibility for the trade. The order of precedent to fill the shoes of a LM are listed below
1. David
2. Brett
3. Chris
4. Jacques
5. Tyler
6. Sam
7. Tim
- During the offseason trading is still allowed.
- Trade deadline is the start of the first game in week 12.
- Draft picks up to 3 years in the future are tradable. Currently 2020, 2021, 2022 picks may be traded.

<br><br>

## __Section IV - Practice Squad__ ##
Practice Squads are housed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rtIk9cXexWhWeFEbZAY-yNwJ-CIxAqTaQqTnnBez7sM).

### Eligibility ###
A player is eligible to be on a practice squad until the first game of the 4th season since the season that ESPN recognizes as their first (looking at the player's "stats" page). In any event causing a player to NOT have a game week 1, then they would be dropped at the conclusion of the final NFL game week 1.

### Call Ups/Down ###
To submit a claim, message your transaction in the Practice squad and IR GroupMe. During the season, practice squads will only be open after the weeks described in the table below and the following week. Players can be called up/sent down after rosters unlock Tuesday morning of weeks (3, 6, 9 and 12) until the players' individually scheduled game the next week.

Players can be dropped from your practice squad at any time. When trading, you can elect to immediately send down a practice squad eligible player you receive in a trade, given you have the space for him, regardless of what week it is. When trading for a player that is on someone else's practice squad, you can elect to immediately call them up to your active roster, again given you have the space, and again regardless of the current week.

## __Section V - Season Ending IR__ ##
Season Ending IR is housed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rtIk9cXexWhWeFEbZAY-yNwJ-CIxAqTaQqTnnBez7sM/edit?usp=sharing).

Players are eligible for season-ending IR if they have the "IR" or "O" injury designation next to their name. You can check IR-eligibility, by going to the "Players" tab and clicking on "IR-eligible" under Heath Status (4th Line). Note that the LMs reserve the right to veto any player's season-ending IR eligibility. 

Players that are placed on season-ending IR cannot be added back to an active roster unless they are traded. If you trade for a player that is on someone's season-ending IR you have the option to immediately activate them, or send them to your [Practice Squad](#section-vi---practice-squad) or season-ending IR, where they will remain for the remainder of the season unless you drop them. You cannot drop a player from your IR and then add them back to your active roster. 


## __Section VI - Rookie Draft__ ##

### Rookie Draft Order ###

### Rookie Draft Settings ###
- There will be 6 rounds of the rookie draft.
- The rookie draft will take on a date after the NFL Draft and before the Regular Season.
- The draft will follow a linear format just like the NFL draft (1.01 has 2.01, 3.01, 4.01 etc.)

__Any undrafted rookie will be treated as a common FA. If they are unavailable in the database you must message the commissioner or co-commissioners to claim them and leave a spot open on your roster once they confirm your request. If no spot is open when the player becomes available then there will be no priority given to the team that claimed them__

<br><br>

#### Notes for 2019 Schedule ####
For some reason we could not manually update the week 1 head to head matchup, so a few tweeks to the schedule were made to avoid playing a person 3 times, never playing someone, and playing someone back to back.

The auto-generated week 1 schedule is 
<br>
1 vs 3
<br>
2 vs 4
<br>
5 vs 7
<br>
6 vs 8
<br>
9 vs 10

- In week three; 1 will play 4 and 2 will play 3. The rest is as depicted above. The reason for this change is because of the week 1 matchup, 2 and 4 were going to play 3 times and 3 and 1 were going to play 3 times. This evens it back to 2 each.
- In week ten; 2 will play 5, 3 will play 6, and 1 will play 7. The rest is as depicted above. The reason for this change is because of the week 1 matchup, 2 never played 5 and 3 never played 6. 1 playing seven is to balance this change.

<br><br>

## __Section VIII - Playoffs__ ##

### Championship Bracket ###
- The four teams will be assigned their playoff seeding spot based on regular season record.
